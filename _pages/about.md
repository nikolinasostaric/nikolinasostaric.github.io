I am a bioinformatician with passion for education.

In my research, I love applying computational tools to explore the behaviour of biomolecules - what they look like, what they do, how they move, who they interact with, and how all these things are brought together inside cells. In pursuing these questions, I work with modelling, molecular dynamics simulations, omics data, and classification from machine learning.

I also enjoy spreading the love towards science through both teaching and science popularization efforts.

Before joining TU Delft, I was a postdoctoral researcher at Sanquin Institute in Amsterdam and an FWO-funded Ph.D. fellow at KU Leuven in Belgium.
