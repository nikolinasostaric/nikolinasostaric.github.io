If you're interested in some of the currently offered projects, or have your own idea of a bioinformatics project you would like to pursue, get in touch at: <b>n.sostaric [at] tudelft [dot] nl</b>

I am currently looking for BEP and MEP students on several topics (see Projects section).

I also have an open PhD position on the topic <i>Predicting compatibility of network-dependent enzymes</i>. You can read more and apply at the following <a https://www.tudelft.nl/over-tu-delft/werken-bij-tu-delft/vacatures/details/?nPostingId=5514&nPostingTargetId=16138&id=QEZFK026203F3VBQBLO6G68W9&LG=UK&languageSelect=UK&mask=external>link</a>.
