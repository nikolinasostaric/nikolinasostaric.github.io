Single-stranded DNA aptamers serve as bioreceptors in wearable biosensors and allow for continuous health monitoring of humans. In this computational project, we will investigate the protein:aptamer interactions to lay the foundation for exciting biosensing applications. To better understand the details of this interactions, we will simulate the aptamer and protein:aptamer complex with molecular dynamics simulations, and try to identify crucial parameters that influence this system, such as temperature, salinity of the buffer, and more.

During this project, you will gain experience with modelling of biomolecules, molecular dynamics simulations of nucleic acids and proteins, and usage of Delft supercomputer. You will also develop a better understanding of biomolecular structure and function, and develop data analysis skills. 

The project will be co-supervised by Lena Fasching.
