Many enzymes rely on intracellular protein networks to acquire essential cofactors or modifications. Due to the evolutionary diversification of such protein networks between species, it is not uncommon for network-dependent enzymes to show limited or no activity when expressed within cells of a foreign species. It is currently not possible to predict whether a given enzyme will show activity when expressed in a foreign species, and this presents a major limitation in bioengineering. For instance, biosynthesis of many valuable molecules, such as biofuels, relies on network-dependent enzymes.

In this project, we will use bioinformatics to gain better understanding of the principles that render an enzyme functional or non-functional within a specific biological background. We will work with state-of-the-art AI tools for protein structure prediction, explore 3D structures and dynamical behaviour of proteins, build machine learning models, and more.
