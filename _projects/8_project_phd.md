Many enzymes rely on intracellular protein networks to acquire essential cofactors or modifications. Due to the evolutionary diversification of such protein networks between species, it is not uncommon for network-dependent enzymes to show limited or no activity when expressed within cells of a foreign species. It is currently not possible to predict whether a given enzyme will show activity when expressed in a foreign species, and this presents a major limitation in bioengineering. For instance, biosynthesis of many valuable molecules, such as biofuels, relies on network-dependent enzymes.

In this PhD project, you will combine bioinformatics with experimental work to gain better understanding of the principles that render an enzyme functional or non-functional within a specific biological background. You will get to work with state-of-the-art AI tools for protein structure prediction, explore 3D structures and dynamical behaviour of proteins, build machine learning models, and verify your predictions in the wet lab.

We are looking for a candidate who:

- Holds (or is approaching the completion of) a Master's degree in Bioinformatics, Molecular biology, Bioengineering, or a related field.
- Has excellent spoken and written English skills.
- Has an affinity for both computational and experimental research (i.e., both bioinformatics/computational biology and molecular biology/biochemistry).
- Has a critical and creative mindset.
- Can work independently and thrives in international, multidisciplinary, collaborative environment.
- Experience with computer programming (Python, R, or another language) and machine learning will be considered a plus.

This project will be done in collaboration with <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/bokinskylab/">Bokinsky lab</a>.
