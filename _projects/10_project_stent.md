Surface properties of stent materials used in atherosclerosis treatment are important for reducing blood cell (platelet) adhesion to the stent and, therefore, preventing potentially life-threatening blood clotting. Several studies have modified physicochemical properties of stents (such as surface chemistry, wettability, surface charge, conductivity, and roughness) by coating with different organic and therapeutic molecules, aiming to reduce the risk of thrombosis. However, a clear molecular mechanism by which stent properties influence thrombogenicity remain unknown. 

In this project, we will employ molecular dynamics simulations to gain insight into the dynamic behavior of blood protein fibrinogen when in contact with stent materials of different physicochemical properties. The advancement of fundamental understanding of stent-blood proteins interactions at a molecular level will aid in the future rational design of stent materials.

For this project, we are looking for a student interested in 3D modelling, interactions of biomolecules, and molecular dynamics simulations.
