FtsZ protein plays an essential role in cell division by forming a contractile ring structure at the division site, thereby controlling both the location and timing of cell division. The minimal divisome of a synthetic cell therefore also relies on FtsZ.

In this project, we will investigate the conservation of FtsZ protein across bacterial species. We will first explore the similarities on sequence level, by finding homologous proteins and building a phylogenetic tree. Moreover, we will investigate FtsZ domains and calculate conservation of key amino acids, such as GTP-binding residues and sites of post-translational modifications. Finally, because proteins with even a moderate sequence similarity may have a conserved 3D structure, we will explore similarity of FtsZ proteins from different organisms on 3D structure level, by comparing the overall folds as well as zooming in on specific parts of protein.

For this project, we are looking for a student interested in bioinformatics.

The project will be co-supervised by Federico Ramirez Gomez.
