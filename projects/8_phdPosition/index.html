Due to the evolutionary diversification of such protein networks between species, it is not uncommon for network-dependent enzymes to show limited or no activity when expressed within cells of a foreign species. It is currently not possible to predict whether a given enzyme will show activity when expressed in a foreign species, and this presents a major limitation in bioengineering. For instance, biosynthesis of many valuable molecules, such as biofuels, relies on network-dependent enzymes.</p> <p>In this PhD project, you will combine bioinformatics with experimental work to gain better understanding of the principles that render an enzyme functional or non-functional within a specific biological background. You will get to work with state-of-the-art AI tools for protein structure prediction, explore 3D structures and dynamical behaviour of proteins, build machine learning models, and verify your predictions in the wet lab.</p> <p>We are looking for a candidate who:</p> <ul> <li>Holds (or is approaching the completion of) a Masterâ€™s degree in Bioinformatics, Molecular biology, Bioengineering, or a related field.</li> <li>Has excellent spoken and written English skills.</li> <li>Has an affinity for both computational and experimental research (i.e., both bioinformatics/computational biology and molecular biology/biochemistry).</li> <li>Has a critical and creative mindset.</li> <li>Can work independently and thrives in international, multidisciplinary, collaborative environment.</li> <li>Experience with computer programming (Python, R, or another language) and machine learning will be considered a plus.</li> </ul> <p>This project will be done in collaboration with <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/bokinskylab/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Bokinsky lab</a>.</p> <p>For more information and to apply, follow this <a href="https://www.tudelft.nl/over-tu-delft/werken-bij-tu-delft/vacatures/details/?nPostingId=5514&amp;nPostingTargetId=16138&amp;id=QEZFK026203F3VBQBLO6G68W9&amp;LG=UK&amp;languageSelect=UK&amp;mask=external" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">link</a>.</p> </body></html>
